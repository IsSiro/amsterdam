					<h4 class="paragraph_title">1. <span class="cian">What</span> is it</h4>
					<p class="paragraph_1 par">Let's talk straight. If you want to see old buildings and all this "classic" <span class="red">stuff</span>, you have a huge amount of tours in <span class="green">most</span> of Europe cities. We decide to start showing you Amsterdam in a way, like we show it to our friends, not <span class="blue">clients</span>. Yes, we have "sightseeing", but there is no castles, only Heineken factory â€” a <span class="violet">huge</span> beer castle. And if you ask almost <span class="green">anywhere</span> in the world what people <span class="cian">associate</span> Amtserdam with, you will hear <span class="violet">tulips</span>, red <span class="red">light</span> district and drugs. We want to prove that <span class="blue">Amsterdam</span> has a lot more colors and shades.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card">
					<h4 class="paragraph_title">2. What can I <span class="orange">visit</span></h4>
					<p class="paragraph_2 par">We have five programs for you with different activities: <span class="green">sightseeing</span>, <span class="orange">relax</span>, <span class="violet">bars</span>, <span class="red">adults only</span> and <span class="yellow">night trips</span>. They are <span class="green">availale</span> everyday but <span class="blue">clearly</span> on schedule. Every program have 3 <span class="cian">different</span> guides, so you can choose any program with three <span class="orange">different</span> start times.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card">
					<h4 class="paragraph_title">3. What <span class="cian">about</span> groups?</h4>
					<p class="paragraph_3 par">Each group shoud have 7-10 people to in order for the program to take <span class="yellow">place</span>. But you can order <span class="blue">individual</span> program to visit <span class="cian">everything</span> in small group or short ones, if you don't <span class="orange">really</span> interested in whole program.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card">
					<h4 class="paragraph_title">4. <span class="red">What</span> about <span class="green">prices</span>?</h4>
					<p class="paragraph_5 par">On the program page you will find three prices: standard, short, individual. This is the price per person (and in an individual program, you can be only one <span class="green">person</span> in a group). We don't offer <span class="blue">discounts</span> for those who take several programs, as we try to make sure that you <span class="violet">almost</span> do not <span class="red">notice</span> how one program has flowed into another and you are already being guided by a new guide. You can even spend the whole day with our guides, as our <span class="yellow">five</span> programs <span class="orange">fit</span> in exactly 24 hours. In this case, there are no discounts, but you will get a really comprehensive <span class="cian">experience</span> from visiting Amsterdam. </p>

If this was the last start of the program today, you can call the <span class="cian">guide</span> and try to <span class="red">catch</span> up with them.

But the "night trips" <span class="yellow">and</span> "adults only" programs have <span class="red">restrictions</span>. In "night trips" you can take a child at least 14 years old, but "adults only" is strictly from 18 <span class="yellow">years</span> and older. If you <span class="violet">have</span> no place to leave your child for this time, and then you go on "night trips", you <span class="orange">can</span> leave your child absolutely free of charge in our office, where <span class="blue">there</span> is a small library and our Internet cafe.</p>
